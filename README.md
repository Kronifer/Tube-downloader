Or YouTube-downloader, Is a lightweight GUI application for downloading Youtube videos with fast speed and high quality,It requires ffmpeg to work.
I made this for learning porpuses and have loads of ideas to improve it :).

# Libraries used
- wxPython
- Pytube

# How this tool works
It downloads the audio and video separately with pytube and then it uses ffmpeg to combine them and creat one video file.
